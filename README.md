# Snake Game üêç

This project is a classic *Snake Game* built using *Python* and the *Turtle* graphics package. The objective is simple‚Äîcontrol the snake to eat food, grow in length, and avoid collisions with the walls or its own body.

## Features

- *Python*: Core game logic is implemented in Python.
- *Turtle Graphics*: Uses the built-in Turtle package for rendering simple, retro-style graphics.
- *Dynamic Gameplay*: The snake grows longer as it eats, making the game progressively more challenging.
- *Score Tracking*: A scoring system keeps track of how many pieces of food the snake consumes.
- *Game Over*: The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or itself.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that *Python 3.x* is installed on your system. The Turtle module is included in Python's standard library, so no additional installations are needed.

### Steps to Run the Game

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/AYUSH-FX/snake-game.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd snake game
   

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   

### How to Play

- *Arrow Keys/WASD*: Use these keys to move the snake in different directions (up, down, left, right).
- *Objective*: Control the snake to eat food, which will make it grow longer. Try to get the highest score without crashing.
- *Game Over*: The game will end if the snake hits the wall or its own body.
